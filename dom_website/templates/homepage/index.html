        Dominic DiCarlo is a third year undergraduate at the University of Chicago, majoring in Psychology and minoring in Computer Science.
        He started this blog so he could practice his writing skills and share his philosophical perspectives on life and the world. 
        He can be found running or biking along Chicagoâ€™s lakeshore when his schedule allows. 
        He would love to talk to you about any of these topics he has wrote about, as well as hear about anything you think he should philosophize on.
