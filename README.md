# Dominic DiCarlo's Website 2019

## About

I am working on a django based website, with my blog, resume, and general info about me for employers and the curious.

The website at branch master is currently hosted at (domdicarlo.com)[https://domdicarlo.com], or (dominicdicarlo.azurewebsites.com)[https://dominicdicarlo.azurewebsites.com]

Because I am on a free tier, the site is not always on. It takes around 15 seconds to load, but after that refershing is quite quick.
